# Description 
Project 1 where we worked on a team to design and develop an app.  We were tasked with using multiple API servers in our code. While also using Github projects, and debuggin in a team settign while pulling, and pushing. The app allows the user to enter their birthdate information, and the return result will display the weather conditions for that day. Also the app will display the image of the day for the user from the seond API.
